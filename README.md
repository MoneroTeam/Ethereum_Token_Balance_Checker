# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Notes

Built with hooks, which is the best practice for React right now.

I used the native Context API to manage overall application state instead of Redux, because there is only 1 reducer and Redux would be overkill.

There is ENS support for more user friendliness.
